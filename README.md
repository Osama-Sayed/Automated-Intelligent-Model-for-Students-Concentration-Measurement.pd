Increasing use of internet and improvements in the field of Information Technology has gradually increased the use of online meetings since last few years and more in a period of time when the whole world turned to work and study online due to COVID- 19,. It has made communication easier, effective and efficient by using some web conferencing software like ezTalks Cloud Meeting, Skype, zoom and Google meet etc. Online meetings have provided a number of advantages especially to the business world as now they can communicate with their colleagues and associates situated at remote locations without moving out of their comfort zone to discuss business strategies and issues face-to-face.
